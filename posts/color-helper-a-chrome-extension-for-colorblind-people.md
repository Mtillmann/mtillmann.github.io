A project that I've been putting off for a long time is finally done. 
I've created a Chrome extension that helps people with color vision deficiency to identify colors and color shades on websites. 

It's simply called _Color Helper_ and it is available on the [chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/color-helper/lppofdjcegodcddmccmnicgfmblkdpbj) for Chrome, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi and other chromium-base browsers and will shortly appear on the edge store.

It uses the fast lookup table algorithm that I've developed for [isit.red](/pages/is-it-red.md) to identify color shades on the page and then displays the color name and the color shade.

[Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44-L_XipVJg) and the [source code](https://github.com/Mtillmann/color-helper-extension) is on GitHub!

I hope this will help some people to better understand colors on the web.
